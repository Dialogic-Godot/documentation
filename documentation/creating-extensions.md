# Creating Extensions

![header_creating_extensions](/media/headers/creating_extensions.png)
***Sometimes dialogic is just not enough***. Whether it's an event, an editor, a setting or a text effect that is missing: You can add it.
An extension is a folder that contains all the information about these things, so that dialogic can use it.
Extensions are very powerful. Actually just as powerful as dialogic built-in stuff (because it works exactly the same).

**Extension can add:** main editors, events, subsystems, text effects & modifiers, portrait animations, settings, character settings, layout presets and dialogic nodes.

## 1. Getting started

The best way to create an extension is to use the extension creator in the dialogic settings (General).

By clicking the `Create New Extension` button you can setup an extension folder and custom event script very quickly. Enter a name for the new module and select what you would like to add. Then click `Create`.

## 2. The essential part: index.gd

The central piece of any extension is the `index.gd` script. It is the only thing your extension is required to have. It has to extend DialogicIndexer and can overwrite that classes methods to let dialogic know about what things to add.
For example this code registers a custom event:

```gdscript
func _get_events() -> Array:
    return [this_folder.path_join('event_print.gd')]
```

# 3. Custom events

## What is an event?

A dialogic event is a script that defines a new class inheriting DialogicEvent. This script will define (a) how the event is represented in editor, (b) how it is saved and also (c) what it does during timeline execution when the event is reached.

Oftentimes events work together with subsystems.

## Your custom event

The Extension creator allows you to get a basic event script. It already has set some values for you.

These are the things you need to fill to make your event fully functional:

#### 1. Event settings:

All options of your event should be stored in variables. Define these at the top.

```gdscript
var print_text :String = ""
var in_game:bool = false
```

#### 2. Execution code:

Add whatever should happen when your event is reached in the `_execute()` method:

```gdscript
func _execute() -> void:
    print(print_text)
    if in_game and Dialogic.has_subsystem('Text'):
        Dialogic.Text.update_dialog_text(print_text)
    else:
        finish()
```

*The `finish()` method let's dialogic know to continue with the next event.*

#### 3. General settings:

In the `_init()` method you can set some base settings of your event:

```gdscript
func _init() -> void:
    event_name = "Printer"
    set_default_color('Color3')
    event_category = Category.Godot
    help_page_path = "localhost"
```

#### 4. Saving/Loading:

To implement shortcode saving, return a shortcode identifier in `get_shortcode()` and fill out `get_shortcode_parameters()`:

```gdscript
func get_shortcode() -> String:
    return "print"


func get_shortcode_parameters() -> Dictionary:
    return {
        #param_name     : property_info
        "text"            : {"property": "print_text", "default": ""},
        "ingame"        : {"property": "in_game",    "default": false},
    }
```

*The above event might be saved as `[print text="Some text to print" in_game="true"]`*
*You can implement a custom saving syntax by overriding `to_text() -> String`, `from_text(@string)` and `is_valid_event(@string) -> bool`. This is what the text-, character, choice, condition and variable events do so take a look at them if this is something you are interested in.*

#### 5. Editor fields:

Your event is now fully functional, but in the visual editor, it is still only blank. You will need to override the `build_event_editor()` method to define the fields/texts that will show on the event.

```gdscript
func build_event_editor() -> void:
   add_header_edit("print_text", ValueType.SingleLineText)
   add_header_edit("in_game", ValueType.Bool, "(also show it in game:", ")", {}, "!print_text.is_empty()")
```

*Other methods you can use are `add_header_label()`, `add_body_edit()` and `add_body_line_break()`. Most of these allow setting a condition as the last parameter, allowing for adaptive visibility. In the example above, the second field will only be visible if any text is typed in the first.*

If you want to learn more about events, I strongly suggest looking at the built-in events.

# 4. Custom Subsystems

## What is a subsystem?

A subsystem is a script that contains useful methods for game execution. Subsystems can be accessed as `Dialogic.SubsystemName.method()` when running the game. They should contain all of your extensions game code.
For example built-in subsystems include `Text, Portraits, Choices, Audio, etc.`. Their methods are used by the built-in events and can be used by your events as well.

Additionally it's good if a subsystem manages dialogic nodes. This could be done like this:

```gdscript
func update_my_dialogic_nodes(some_setting):
    for node in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("dialogic_custom_nodes"):
        node.update_something(some_setting)
```

## Your custom subsystem

A subsystem is a script inheriting `DialogicSubsystem`. It can override that classes methods.
The most important methods you might want to override are `clear_game_state()` and `load_game_state()` for saving and loading and `pause()` and `resume()` for pausing.
If you want save-persistent data, store it in the `Dialogic.current_state_info` dictionary.

# 5. Custom animations

## What is an animation

Portrait animations are scripts extending the `DialogicAnimation` class. The easiest way to register them is to have them in a subfolder of your module and then add the following code to the `index.gd` file:

```gdscript
func _get_portrait_animations() -> Array:
    return list_dir('Animations')
```

## Creating an animation

Animations are little scripts inheriting the `DialogicAnimation` class, you can take a look at the default ones (they use tweens) at `dialogic/Modules/Character/DefaultAnimations`.

Your animation script should look something like this (bounce_in as example):


### ❗ Animation Example Bounce

```gdscript
extends DialogicAnimation

func animate():
    var tween := (node.create_tween() as Tween)
    node.scale = Vector2()
    node.modulate.a = 0

    tween.set_ease(Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)
    tween.set_trans(Tween.TRANS_SINE)
    tween.set_parallel()
    tween.tween_property(node, 'scale', Vector2(1,1), time).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_SPRING).set_ease(Tween.EASE_OUT)
    tween.tween_property(node, 'modulate:a', 1.0, time)
    tween.finished.connect(emit_signal.bind('finished_once'))
```

*It's important that you:*

- extend the `DialogicAnimation` class and implement the animate() method
- at some point emit the `finished_once` signal (it's called like this because animations can be repeated by dialogic)

*You have the following variables given to work of:*

- **node** = the node to animate. This is NOT your portrait node directly, but a Node2D that holds that portrait node
- **time** = the amount of time the animation should take
- **end_position** = where to end the animation
- **orig_pos** = the position you started at

# 6. Custom dialogic nodes

## What are dialogic nodes?

[Dialogic node](/documentation/dialogic-nodes) are nodes that in some way execute something visibly, logically or audibly.
They are generally managed by a subsystem and found because they are automatically added to a group. This makes sure it doesn't matter where in the scene tree they are and how many of them exist.

DialogicNodes do not need to be added by the index.gd file!

---

# 7. Custom Settings Pages

An extension might want to add a dialogic settings editor. This is just a UI scene that has a script inheriting `DialogicSettingsPage`.

- overwrite some methods (just the ones that you need)
  - `_get_title()`
  - _get_priority() -> return an int that will influence the order of settings pages
  - _refresh() -> whenever the settings are opened
  - _about_to_close() -> whenever the settings editor closes
  - _get_info_section() -> return a node in your scene that will be used as an info section
- settings are usually saved either
  - in the `project settings` in a subcategory of dialogic (e.g. `dialogic/myextension/setting`):
    - `ProjectSettings.set_setting('dialogic/myextension/setting', some_value)`
  - you can also save/load editor settings with `DialogicUtil.set_editor_setting('setting', value)` and DialogicUtil.get_editor_setting('setting').
    - these are project-dependant
- remember that all scripts in this scene must be in @tool mode.
