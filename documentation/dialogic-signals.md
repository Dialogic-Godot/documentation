# Dialogic Signals

![header_signals](/media/headers/signals.png)

Dialogic provides a lot of signals that allow you to do all kinds of things.
If you are new to godot's signals [learn how to use them here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html).

## Signal event

The signal event will emit the signal `Dialogic.signal_event` and pass along the argument given in the event.

*Here the argument is `"activate_something"`.*

To react to the signal event, connect to it before starting your dialog:

```gdscript
func _ready():
     Dialogic.signal_event.connect(_on_dialogic_signal)

func _on_dialogic_signal(argument:String):
    if argument == "activate_something":
        print("Something was activated!")
```

## Text signal

When using the `[signal=activate_something]` text effect, dialogic will emit the `Dialogic.text_signal` signal with the given argument.

You can connect it the same way as the signal_event signal:

```gdscript
func _ready():
     Dialogic.text_signal.connect(_on_dialogic_text_signal)

func _on_dialogic_text_signal(argument:String):
    if argument == "activate_something":
        print("Something was activated!")
```

## Start & End signals

Using the `Dialogic.timeline_ended` and `Dialogic.timeline_started` signals (both have no arguments) let's you react to dialog ending or beginning.

Example:

```gdscript
func start_dialog():
    Dialogic.timeline_ended.connect(_on_timeline_ended)
    Dialogic.start("my_timeline")

func _on_timeline_ended():
    Dialogic.timeline_ended.disconnect(_on_timeline_ended)
    # do something else here
```

## Subsystem signals

Dialogic subsystems have a lot of useful signals. Here is a selection of them:

- `Dialogic.Text` has

  - signal `about_to_show_text(info:Dictionary)`
  - signal `text_finished(info:Dictionary)`
  - signal `speaker_updated(character:DialogicCharacter)`
  - signal `textbox_visibility_changed(visible:bool)`
  - signal `animation_textbox_new_text`
  - signal `animation_textbox_show`
  - signal `animation_textbox_hide`

- `Dialogic.Portraits` has

  - signal `character_joined(info:Dictionary)`
  - signal `character_left(info:Dictionary)`
  - signal `character_portrait_changed(info:Dictionary)`

- `Dialogic.VAR` has

  - signal `variable_changed(info:Dictionary)`
  - signal `variable_was_set(info:Dictionary)` # only on set variable events

And many more. If you want to react to something particular happying, take a look if the responsible subsystem maybe has a signal for that.
